  aboutTitle: "I'm John Ademola, an AI/ML Engineer & Graduate Student at Purdue University",
  aboutDescription: `My journey into AI/ML began with a fascination for making complex systems intuitive and human-friendly. With experience spanning prompt engineering, NLP, and RAG systems, I specialize in bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical applications.

Currently pursuing my Master's degree with a perfect 4.0 GPA while serving as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I've had the privilege of working on transformative projects like Somalens, an AI-powered health prediction platform, and developing bias-mitigated ML models for real-world applications.

From architecting cloud-native solutions that reduced infrastructure costs by 25% to building neural networks achieving 85% F1 scores, I'm passionate about creating AI solutions that are both technically robust and genuinely helpful to users.`,
